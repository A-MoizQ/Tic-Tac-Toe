### Goal of this project
  It is a project from a workshop I attended after my first semester ended in December,2023. The main purpose of the workshop was to make us familiar with python programming. Along with that we learned how to do Model, View, Control (MVC); Which is a programming practice widely used in the industry. This is my first ever project made using the MVC.
